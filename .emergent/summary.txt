The user wants to continue their project 'Artywiz mobile' by importing it from a GitHub repository. After the successful import, the user requested a review of the app's structure for optimization, scalability, and the future addition of a desktop version.

The primary goal is to build a V1 MVP of the Artywiz app. This version will act as a client for an existing Artywiz backend system.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (V1 MVP):**
- Connect to the existing Artywiz user authentication system.
- The app should allow users (from football clubs, districts, etc.) to log in.
- Display a list of documents available to the user, created by the Artywiz service.
- Allow users to visualize and validate documents. This sends information back to the Artywiz backend.
- The Artywiz backend will send an alert when a final document is ready.
- The user can then receive the final document (image/PDF).
- The app should allow publishing the final document to social media (Facebook/Instagram).

The user also made several specific UI/UX requests throughout the session, including:
- Replacing the background image with a looping video.
- Ensuring the video background is continuous between screens (attempted and reverted, but still a desired feature).
- Adjusting logo animations and visibility.
- Adding a new Mon profil (sector selection) screen to the signup flow.
- Renaming and restyling various UI elements for consistency.
- Implementing  on the signup form.
- Reversing the background video's playback direction on navigation.

**User's preferred language**: French

**what currently exists?**
The Artywiz mobile project has been successfully imported from GitHub. The initial mocked authentication has been replaced with a functional, self-contained JWT-based authentication system (FastAPI backend, React Native frontend with React Query). The UI has been significantly updated based on user feedback, including adding a video background to auth screens and creating a new sector selection screen. Numerous UI bugs and inconsistencies have been fixed. The application is a single Expo codebase that can be built for both mobile and web, aligning with the user's goal of a future desktop version.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing a batch of three UI/UX refinements requested by the user:
    1.  Adding  to the first input field on the Rejoignez Artywiz (signup) screen.
    2.  Making the logo animation on the Mon profil screen identical to other auth screens.
    3.  Implementing a feature to reverse the background video's playback direction upon navigation between auth screens.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? both
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1:  The background video does not play continuously when navigating between the welcome, login, and signup screens. It restarts on each screen. (Priority: P2)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent attempted to fix this by creating a  to wrap the navigation stack, aiming to have a single, persistent video instance. This approach failed due to complexities with z-index and component lifecycle in React Navigation and React Native Web. The agent reverted this complex implementation in favor of a simpler, working approach where each screen has its own video instance, but this re-introduced the original problem of the video restarting.
     - Next debug checklist: 
       - Re-evaluate the  approach. The issue might be solvable by correctly managing  and ensuring all parent containers in the navigation stack have transparent backgrounds (e.g., the  ).
       - Explore lifting the state of the video (, ) to a shared context or state manager (like Zustand), and passing the  down to each  component. This might allow control over a single video element even if the component re-mounts.
       - Investigate if a different navigation structure could support a shared background, such as nesting navigators inside a View that contains the background.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? The user explicitly requested a fluid, continuous background animation to improve the user experience and make the app feel more polished.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  Task 1:  Finalize and test the three UI/UX refinements requested by the user. (Priority: P0)
  
 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: The agent has already written the code for all three parts. The next step is to restart the services and thoroughly test each feature to ensure it works as expected.
       1.  **autoFocus**: Verify that when navigating to the signup screen, the keyboard appears automatically and the cursor is in the Nom field.
       2.  **Logo Animation**: Visually compare the logo animation on  with  to confirm they are identical in timing, scale, and easing.
       3.  **Video Direction**: Navigate back and forth between the auth screens (welcome, login, signup, sector-selection) and observe if the background video appears to play in reverse on alternate navigations.
     - What will be achieved with this? This will complete the user's latest batch of UI refinement requests, improving usability and visual consistency.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- **P0: Integrate with existing Artywiz Backend API**: This is the most critical next step for the V1 MVP.
  - The current self-contained auth backend is temporary.
  - Obtain API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI spec) from the user's lead developer, Donny.
  - Refactor  and  to connect to the real Artywiz endpoints for login, user profile fetching, etc.
- **P1: Implement V1 MVP Core Document Flow**:
  - Create/update screens to display the list of documents fetched from the Artywiz API.
  - Implement the document visualization screen.
  - Build the form/flow for a user to validate a document, sending the required info to the backend.
  - Implement handling for doc ready alerts from the backend (initially in-app, potentially push notifications later).
  - Implement the flow to retrieve the final document and publish it to social media (Meta API integration).
- **P2: Responsive Desktop Layout**:
  - Implement responsive breakpoints.
  - Create an adaptive navigation system (e.g., bottom tabs on mobile, sidebar on desktop).
  - Adjust layouts and sizing for larger screens, starting with the dashboard.

Future Tasks:
- Implement OAuth for social logins (Meta, LinkedIn) correctly, connecting to the real Artywiz backend flow.
- Add features for V2 and beyond, such as multi-sport support, custom templates, AI generation, and analytics.
- Integrate with Jira for project management, as requested by the user for their project manager, Ari.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Project Import**: Successfully cloned the user's 'Artywiz mobile' project from GitHub and integrated it into the workspace.
- **Auth System Refactor**: Replaced mocked data with a full-stack JWT authentication system (FastAPI backend, React Query on frontend).
- **UI/UX Enhancements**:
  - Replaced static background images with a looping video on auth screens (, , ).
  - Created a new Mon profil () screen in the signup flow.
  - Standardized UI styles (logo, titles, buttons) across auth screens for consistency.
  - Renamed bottom tab bar menu items as requested.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Implemented user-facing error messages for existing email on registration.
  - Fixed a critical API URL bug preventing frontend-backend communication in the test environment.
  - Resolved a visual flash in the  carousel animation.
  - Corrected multiple layout and styling issues identified by the user on the  screen.

- Recently completed:
  -  on signup form (code written, pending testing)
  - Unification of logo animation (code written, pending testing)
  - Initial implementation of reversing video background (code written, pending testing)

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The user mentioned bugs with OAuth Meta/LinkedIn, DocShowcase carousel in a summary message (Message 61). The DocShowcase carousel flash was fixed, but the OAuth issues have not been addressed as the focus shifted to the custom JWT auth. This will need to be revisited when implementing social login against the real Artywiz backend.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None. This is the first fork of this project.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React Native, Expo (with Expo Router for file-based routing), TypeScript, React Reanimated (for animations), React Query (for server state management), Axios.
-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, MongoDB (via  for async access), Passlib (for hashing), PyJWT (for tokens).
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack monorepo with a decoupled frontend and backend. The current setup is a self-contained auth system, but the target architecture is for the frontend to be a client to a separate, existing Artywiz backend.

**key DB schema**
- **users**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- No major changes in the core stack (Expo, FastAPI, Mongo).
- Introduced  for frontend server state management, which is a significant pattern improvement over the previous mocked data service.

**All files of reference**
- : Updated to include  and  endpoints.
- : New file defining the User model.
- : New file for the centralized Axios client. Handles environment-specific API URLs.
- : New file with  and  hooks.
- : Updated to include  and .
- : Refactored to use  hook.
- : Refactored to use  hook and display backend error messages.
- : New screen for the signup flow.
- : New component to display the background video, with a web-specific implementation.
- : New provider to manage video playback direction.
- : Modified to fix an animation flash.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The video background implementation could be improved. The revert from the  approach means code is duplicated across three screens. If the continuous playback is a high priority, this should be revisited.
- The logo animation logic is duplicated across , , and . It was partially refactored into a  component but then further edited. Consolidating this into a single, configurable  component would be beneficial.

**key api endpoints**
- : Creates a new user. (currently in the local FastAPI backend)
- : Logs in a user and returns a JWT access token. (currently in the local FastAPI backend)
- : A simple health-check endpoint.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The app's purpose has changed**: It is now a **client for an existing Artywiz backend**. The agent must not add more features to the current temporary FastAPI backend. The next major task is to integrate with the real API, which will be provided by the user's team member, Donny.
- **User is very UI/UX focused**: Pay close attention to user feedback on animations, styling, and flow. The user often provides very specific and detailed requests.
- **Respond in French**: The user communicates exclusively in French. All responses must be in French.
- **Unified Codebase Goal**: The user wants a single codebase for mobile and desktop. The current Expo project already supports this. Keep this in mind for future layout and navigation work.

**documents created in this job**
- None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: Nothing is critically broken. The app launches and the core auth screens are functional.
- **Mocked**: The entire backend is effectively a mock of the real Artywiz system. The connection to the real backend API is the main pending task.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None currently active. The V1 MVP will require integration with the Meta API (Facebook/Instagram) for publishing.

**Testing status**
- Testing agent used after significant changes: NO (Agent used  and  for manual testing).
- Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
- Test files created: []
- Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- User registration can be done with any fake //.
- Example for testing login after registration:
  - email: 
  - password: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has been diligent in addressing user requests. The only miss was the failed attempt to implement a continuous video background, but it was a pragmatic decision to revert to a working state rather than getting stuck. The agent has not forgotten any major tasks listed by the user.
